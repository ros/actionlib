 * or cancel requests come over the wire, and passes back GoalHandles that
 * can be used to track the state of a given goal request. The ActionServer
 * makes no assumptions about the policy used to service these goals, and
 * sends status for each goal over the wire until the last GoalHandle
 * associated with a goal request is destroyed.
