 * specification of the policy is as follows: only one goal can have an
 * active status at a time, new goals preempt previous goals based on the
 * stamp in their GoalID field (later goals preempt earlier ones), an
 * explicit preempt goal preempts all goals with timestamps that are less
 * than or equal to the stamp associated with the preempt, accepting a new
 * goal implies successful preemption of any old goal and the status of the
 * old goal will be change automatically to reflect this.
