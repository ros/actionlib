## @class SimpleActionServer
## @brief The SimpleActionServer
## implements a singe goal policy on top of the ActionServer class. The
## specification of the policy is as follows: only one goal can have an
## active status at a time, new goals preempt previous goals based on the
## stamp in their GoalID field (later goals preempt earlier ones), an
## explicit preempt goal preempts all goals with timestamps that are less
## than or equal to the stamp associated with the preempt, accepting a new
## goal implies successful preemption of any old goal and the status of the
## old goal will be change automatically to reflect this.

    ## @param  auto_start A boolean value that tells the ActionServer wheteher or not to start publishing as soon as it comes up. THIS SHOULD ALWAYS BE SET TO FALSE TO AVOID RACE CONDITIONS and start() should be called after construction of the server.
