## @class ActionServer
## @brief The ActionServer is a helpful tool for managing goal requests to a
## node. It allows the user to specify callbacks that are invoked when goal
## or cancel requests come over the wire, and passes back GoalHandles that
## can be used to track the state of a given goal request. The ActionServer
## makes no assumptions about the policy used to service these goals, and
## sends status for each goal over the wire until the last GoalHandle
## associated with a goal request is destroyed.
class ActionServer:

    ## @param  ns/name A namespace for the action server

    ## @param  goal_cb A goal callback to be called when the ActionServer receives a new goal over the wire
    ## @param  cancel_cb A cancel callback to be called when the ActionServer receives a new cancel request over the wire
    ## @param  auto_start A boolean value that tells the ActionServer wheteher or not to start publishing as soon as it comes up. THIS SHOULD ALWAYS BE SET TO FALSE TO AVOID RACE CONDITIONS and start() should be called after construction of the server.
